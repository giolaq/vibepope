# Alphabetical Cardinal Data Scraping Plan

## Background and Motivation
We need to create a comprehensive dataset of all cardinals by scraping the Vatican website alphabetically, starting from letter A. This will ensure we capture all cardinals in a systematic way and maintain data completeness.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Need to handle alphabetical navigation through the website
2. Need to extract both English and Italian versions of biographies
3. Need to maintain data consistency across different language versions
4. Need to handle rate limiting and server load
5. Need to ensure proper error handling and recovery
6. Need to maintain progress tracking for long-running scraping

## High-level Task Breakdown

### 1. Setup and Initialization
- [ ] Create a new script for alphabetical scraping
- [ ] Set up proper directory structure for data storage
- [ ] Implement logging and progress tracking
- [ ] Create a data model for cardinal information

### 2. Alphabetical Navigation Implementation
- [ ] Implement function to get all cardinal links for a specific letter
- [ ] Create a function to extract cardinal information from each link
- [ ] Implement error handling for failed requests
- [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed requests

### 3. Data Extraction and Processing
- [ ] Extract basic information (name, title, etc.)
- [ ] Extract biographical information
- [ ] Extract photo URLs
- [ ] Handle both English and Italian versions
- [ ] Implement data validation

### 4. Data Storage and Management
- [ ] Create a structured JSON format for cardinal data
- [ ] Implement incremental saving of data
- [ ] Create backup mechanism
- [ ] Implement data deduplication

### 5. Progress Tracking and Recovery
- [ ] Implement checkpoint system
- [ ] Create progress reporting
- [ ] Add ability to resume from last successful letter
- [ ] Implement error logging and reporting

## Project Status Board
- [ ] Setup complete
- [ ] Alphabetical navigation working
- [ ] Data extraction working
- [ ] Data storage working
- [ ] Progress tracking working

# Cardinal Information Extraction Plan

## Background and Motivation
We need to extract specific information about each cardinal from the Vatican website, including their name, date of birth, creation date, and country. The data is available on the cardinal electors page and their individual biography pages.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Need to parse the main page to get all cardinal links
2. Need to extract specific information from each cardinal's biography page
3. Need to handle different date formats and naming conventions
4. Need to ensure data consistency and completeness
5. Need to handle rate limiting and server load
6. Need to maintain progress tracking for long-running scraping

## Detailed Page Analysis
Upon analysis of the cardinal electors page (https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/documentation/card_bio_typed/card_bio_ele.html), we've discovered the following structure:

1. The page contains 135 cardinals in total
2. Cardinals are organized in a table with alphabetical sections
3. Each cardinal entry contains:
   - Full name (with surname in uppercase)
   - Link to biography page (href contains "card_bio")
   - Birth date in DD-MM-YYYY format
   - Pope who appointed them (Francis, Benedict XVI, or John Paul II)
   - Country of origin

The page doesn't use consistent class names for cardinal entries, which has complicated our initial extraction attempts. Instead, we need to:
1. Target all links containing "card_bio" in their href attribute
2. Filter out navigation and language links ("Back to top", "English", "Italian")
3. Extract surrounding text to get birth date, appointing pope, and country
4. Use regex patterns to extract structured data

## High-level Task Breakdown

### 1. Main Page Parsing
- [x] Extract all cardinal links from the main page by targeting `<div class="listTitle">` elements which contain the cardinal links
- [x] Filter out navigation links and section headers
- [x] Create a mapping of cardinal names to their biography URLs
- [x] Implement error handling for failed requests

### 2. Data Extraction from Main Page
- [x] Extract name from link text
- [x] Extract birth date from table structure (3rd column)
- [x] Extract appointing pope from table structure (4th column)
- [x] Extract country from table structure (5th column)
- [x] Implement validation for extracted data

### 3. Biography Page Processing (if needed)
- [ ] Extract additional information from individual biography pages:
  - [ ] Full biographical text
  - [ ] Current position
  - [ ] Photo URL
- [ ] Handle different page formats and structures
- [ ] Implement data validation

### 4. Data Storage and Management
- [x] Create a structured JSON format for cardinal data
- [x] Implement incremental saving of data
- [ ] Create backup mechanism
- [ ] Implement data deduplication

### 5. Progress Tracking and Recovery
- [x] Implement checkpoint system
- [x] Create progress reporting
- [ ] Add ability to resume from last successful cardinal
- [x] Implement error logging and reporting

- [x] Data extraction from main page working
- [ ] Biography page processing working (if needed)
- [x] Data storage working
- [x] Progress tracking working

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
We've successfully resolved the cardinal data extraction issue. After analyzing the HTML structure more carefully, we found that:

1. The cardinals are displayed in a table structure on the webpage
2. Each cardinal entry is contained in a `<div class="listTitle">` element within a table row
3. The cardinal's additional information (birth date, appointing pope, country) is available in separate table cells (td elements) in the same row

The updated extraction approach:
1. Find all elements with class "listTitle" which contain the cardinal links
2. Get the parent table row (tr) for each listTitle element
3. Extract the data from the specific td elements in the row:
   - Name from the link text in the listTitle div
   - Birth date from the 3rd column (index 2)
   - Appointing pope from the 4th column (index 3)
   - Country from the 5th column (index 4)

This approach correctly identified 135 cardinals from the webpage, matching the expected total.

## Lessons
1. The Vatican website's HTML structure does not consistently use semantic class names for cardinal entries
2. The page contains 135 cardinals according to the footer, which our updated extraction approach now correctly identifies
3. Direct targeting of biography links is more reliable than looking for specific structural elements
4. Understanding the table structure was crucial for properly extracting all the cardinal data
5. Always analyze the HTML structure carefully before implementing extraction logic
6. Saving raw HTML for inspection helped diagnose and fix the extraction issue
