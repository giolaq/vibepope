# Cardinal Information Extraction Plan

## Background and Motivation
We need to extract specific information about each cardinal from the Vatican website, including their name, date of birth, creation date, and country. The data is available on the cardinal electors page and their individual biography pages.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Need to parse the main page to get all cardinal links
2. Need to extract specific information from each cardinal's biography page
3. Need to handle different date formats and naming conventions
4. Need to ensure data consistency and completeness
5. Need to handle rate limiting and server load
6. Need to maintain progress tracking for long-running scraping

## Detailed Page Analysis
Upon analysis of the cardinal electors page (https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/documentation/card_bio_typed/card_bio_ele.html), we've discovered the following structure:

1. The page contains 135 cardinals in total
2. Cardinals are organized in a table with alphabetical sections
3. Each cardinal entry contains:
   - Full name (with surname in uppercase)
   - Link to biography page (href contains "card_bio")
   - Birth date in DD-MM-YYYY format
   - Pope who appointed them (Francis, Benedict XVI, or John Paul II)
   - Country of origin

The page doesn't use consistent class names for cardinal entries, which has complicated our initial extraction attempts. Instead, we need to:
1. Target all links containing "card_bio" in their href attribute
2. Filter out navigation and language links ("Back to top", "English", "Italian")
3. Extract surrounding text to get birth date, appointing pope, and country
4. Use regex patterns to extract structured data

## High-level Task Breakdown

### 1. Main Page Parsing
- [x] Extract all cardinal links from the main page by targeting `<div class="listTitle">` elements which contain the cardinal links
- [x] Filter out navigation links and section headers
- [x] Create a mapping of cardinal names to their biography URLs
- [x] Implement error handling for failed requests

### 2. Data Extraction from Main Page
- [x] Extract name from link text
- [x] Extract birth date from table structure (3rd column)
- [x] Extract appointing pope from table structure (4th column)
- [x] Extract country from table structure (5th column)
- [x] Implement validation for extracted data

### 3. Biography Page Processing (if needed)
- [ ] Extract additional information from individual biography pages:
  - [ ] Full biographical text
  - [ ] Current position
  - [ ] Photo URL
- [ ] Handle different page formats and structures
- [ ] Implement data validation

### 4. Data Storage and Management
- [x] Create a structured JSON format for cardinal data
- [x] Implement incremental saving of data
- [ ] Create backup mechanism
- [ ] Implement data deduplication

### 5. Progress Tracking and Recovery
- [x] Implement checkpoint system
- [x] Create progress reporting
- [ ] Add ability to resume from last successful cardinal
- [x] Implement error logging and reporting

## Project Status Board
- [x] Main page parsing working
- [x] Data extraction from main page working
- [ ] Biography page processing working (if needed)
- [x] Data storage working
- [x] Progress tracking working

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
We've successfully resolved the cardinal data extraction issue. After analyzing the HTML structure more carefully, we found that:

1. The cardinals are displayed in a table structure on the webpage
2. Each cardinal entry is contained in a `<div class="listTitle">` element within a table row
3. The cardinal's additional information (birth date, appointing pope, country) is available in separate table cells (td elements) in the same row

The updated extraction approach:
1. Find all elements with class "listTitle" which contain the cardinal links
2. Get the parent table row (tr) for each listTitle element
3. Extract the data from the specific td elements in the row:
   - Name from the link text in the listTitle div
   - Birth date from the 3rd column (index 2)
   - Appointing pope from the 4th column (index 3)
   - Country from the 5th column (index 4)

This approach correctly identified 135 cardinals from the webpage, matching the expected total.

## Lessons
1. The Vatican website's HTML structure does not consistently use semantic class names for cardinal entries
2. The page contains 135 cardinals according to the footer, which our updated extraction approach now correctly identifies
3. Direct targeting of biography links is more reliable than looking for specific structural elements
4. Understanding the table structure was crucial for properly extracting all the cardinal data
5. Always analyze the HTML structure carefully before implementing extraction logic
6. Saving raw HTML for inspection helped diagnose and fix the extraction issue

# VibePope Cardinal Recommendation Engine

## Background and Motivation
The VibePope app currently allows users to browse and view information about cardinals. We need to enhance it by adding a feature that recommends a "favorite cardinal" based on the user's personal information and preferences.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
Task 1 (User Preference Form Creation) has been completed. I've created the following components:

1. `CardinalPreferenceForm.js` - A form component that:
   - Collects user information (name, gender, age, country, interests)
   - Implements form validation for required fields
   - Uses Material UI components for a consistent look and feel
   - Provides clear validation messages

2. `CardinalMatch.js` - A page component that:
   - Hosts the form component
   - Manages the form data
   - Displays the matched cardinal when available
   - Shows a loading indicator during API requests
   - Provides error messages when needed

Additionally, I've:
- Added the new page to the routing configuration in `App.js`
- Added a navigation link in the Navbar
- Implemented a preliminary matching algorithm that considers country, age, and interests

The implementation allows users to submit their information and see a matching cardinal with an explanation of why they were matched.

While the matching algorithm is currently simple, the structure is in place to enhance it in future tasks.

Task 2 (Cardinal Attribute Analysis) has been completed. After analyzing the cardinal data, I've identified the following attributes that can be used for matching:

1. **Basic Cardinal Attributes (already in the data model):**
   - Country (matching user's country with cardinal's country)
   - Age-related data (calculated from birth_date)
   - Name and basic biographical information

2. **Enhanced Cardinal Attributes (from structured_bio and additional_info):**
   - Education background (theological specialties, academic fields)
   - Birth place
   - Ordination date
   - Cardinal creation date

3. **Cardinal Interest Areas (extracted from biography):**
   - Theological interests
   - Social justice involvement
   - Educational background
   - Mission work
   - Leadership roles

The cardinal data is stored in a JSON format and includes both basic information and enhanced attributes in an `additional_info` object. The API already supports retrieving this data, which makes it suitable for implementing the matching algorithm.

I've identified that we can leverage the existing `getCardinals` API function to fetch cardinal data in bulk, which will allow us to implement the matching algorithm on the client side without needing to modify the backend API immediately.

Task 3 (Matching Algorithm Development) has been completed. I've enhanced the matching algorithm with the following improvements:

1. **Weighted Scoring System:** 
   - Implemented a scoring system that assigns points to different matching criteria:
     - Country match: 25 points
     - Age group similarity: up to 20 points
     - Interest matches: up to 35 points
     - Education alignment: 10 points
     - Gender considerations: 10 points

2. **Interest Matching:**
   - Created a keyword-based system that matches user interests with cardinal biographies
   - Each user interest has associated keywords that are searched for in the cardinal's biographical text
   - Multiple interest matches increase the overall score

3. **Age Calculation:**
   - Implemented date parsing to extract cardinal ages from birth dates
   - Created tiered scoring based on age proximity between user and cardinal

4. **Cardinal Ranking:**
   - Scores all cardinals and ranks them by total score
   - Selects the highest-scoring cardinal as the best match

5. **Enhanced Reasoning:**
   - Generates detailed, personalized explanations based on the specific matching criteria
   - Includes information about shared country, age proximity, interest alignment, and educational background
   - Provides fallback messages for cases with limited matches

6. **Fallback Logic:**
   - Ensures that even with limited matching criteria, users still receive a cardinal match
   - Adds inspirational messages when specific matching reasons are limited

The enhanced algorithm provides more personalized and meaningful matches, with detailed explanations of why each cardinal was selected, creating a more engaging user experience.

Task 4 (API Integration) has been completed. I've implemented the following:

1. **Server-side API Endpoint:**
   - Added a new `/api/recommend` POST endpoint to the Express server
   - Implemented validation for user preferences input
   - Transferred the matching algorithm logic to the server to provide consistent results
   - Enhanced the API to return multiple recommendations (top 3 matches) instead of just one

2. **Client-side API Integration:**
   - Created a new `getCardinalRecommendations` function in the API service
   - Updated the CardinalMatch component to use the new API endpoint
   - Implemented fallback to client-side matching if the API call fails
   - Added error handling for network issues or server errors

3. **Multiple Recommendations:**
   - Modified the UI to display alternative matches when available
   - Added the ability to switch between different recommendations
   - Enhanced the display with a card-based layout for alternative matches

4. **Resilient Implementation:**
   - The system works in both online and offline modes
   - If the API is unavailable, the client-side matching algorithm serves as a reliable fallback
   - All matching logic is shared between client and server for consistency

The implementation now provides a more robust experience with server-side processing for better performance and consistency, while still maintaining resilience when network connectivity is limited.

1. When adding new routes to a React Router setup, we need to update both the routing configuration and the navigation components
2. Reusing existing components (like CardinalCard) helps maintain consistency in the UI
3. Form validation is crucial for ensuring data quality before processing
4. It's important to handle loading states and errors to provide a good user experience
5. The matching algorithm can be improved by analyzing more attributes and refining the logic
6. The implementation of the recommendation feature shows the importance of user-centered design in software development
7. Cardinal data already includes rich information that can be used for personalized matching
8. Data structures should be analyzed thoroughly before implementing algorithms that rely on them
9. The existing API infrastructure can be leveraged for the initial implementation before any backend modifications
10. When matching text data, using keyword lists for each category improves accuracy
11. A weighted scoring system provides flexibility in prioritizing different matching criteria
12. Providing detailed match explanations enhances user engagement and satisfaction
13. Fallback logic is essential to ensure users always receive a meaningful match
14. Duplicating matching logic on both client and server enables graceful degradation
15. Implementing server-side processing can improve performance for complex calculations
16. Returning multiple recommendations gives users choice and increases engagement
