    "biography_text": "Cardinal Vinko Puljić,Archbishop emeritus of Vrhbosna, Sarajevo (Bosnia-Ercegovina),was born on 8 September 1945 in Prijećani, in the Diocese of Banja Luka. He completed his secondary education at the interdiocesan minor seminary of Zagreb and the minor seminary of Djakovo. He studied philosophy and theology at the major seminary of Djakovo and was ordained a priest in the Cathedral of Djakovo on 29 June 1970. Pope John Paul II appointed him Archbishop of Vrhbosna, Sarajevo on 19 November 1990 and in 1991 at the tomb of St Peter ordained him Bishop on the Solemnity of the Epiphany.\nHis family was materially poor but rich in the Catholic faith. He was the 12th of 13 children. When he was barely three years old, his mother Kaja, died. His father remarried and the little Vinko with his other brothers and sisters found a new mother in his step-mother Ana, who brought him up as if he were her own son.\nAlready as a child he displayed the great piety which he had inherited from his family when every evening they knelt to pray the Holy Rosary. His father Ivan, led the prayers. Later, as spiritual director at the minor seminary ‘Vicko Zmajević’ of Zara (Croatia) whenever he saw a boy having difficulty praying with his arms extended, Fr Vinko would frequently remember the words of his father who used to say to him: 'Son, remember, Jesus hung on the cross with his arms extended, while you cannot even manage to pray for a couple of minutes extending yours!' One of the characteristics of young Vinko's piety was a special devotion to the Mother of God, which he has always retained.\nIn addition to his family, young Vinko's spiritual formation was deeply influenced by the Trappist Monastery of Marija Zvijezda, located not far from his native village. It was one of the monks precisely, who helped Vinko's father to send his son to the minor seminary of Zagreb. Actually, Fr Ante Artner sold his motorbike and gave the proceeds to Vinko's father who did not have enough money to pay his board there. This story was only told by Father Ante on the occasion when the new priest Vinko celebrated his first Mass in 1970.\nAfter his ordination to the priesthood, he became chaplain in Banja Luka, until spring 1973. Before moving to the parish of Sasina, where he stayed from June to November 1973, for three months, from April to June, he worked in the Episcopal Curia of Banja Luka. From 1973 to 1978 he was parish priest of Ravska, near the mine of Ljubija. In autumn 1978, he was named spiritual director of the minor seminary ‘Vicko Zmajević’ of Zara.\nAs soon as he arrived at the seminary, he immediately made it into a large family. The seminarians were like younger brothers to him, while for them, he was a real father and elder brother whom they could trust. During the summer holidays, he did not lose touch with his seminarians, but visited them in their villages, and corresponded with them. He was concerned above all that his boys should understand and better accept their priestly vocation. During one of his stays in Zadar, he was confessor at the Benedictine monastery and organized numerous spiritual retreats for priests, seminarians and women religious.\nWhen his work as spiritual director of the minor seminary of Zadar came to an end in summer 1987, he returned to his Diocese and was named parish priest of Bosanska Gradiška. He stayed there until summer 1990 when he was transferred to Sarajevo as vice- rector of the major seminary of the ecclesiastical province of Vrhbosna. On 19 November 1990, while he was in Sarajevo the news of his appointment as Archbishop reached him. He thus became the sixth Archbishop of that See after the reconstruction of the ordinary ecclesiastical hierarchy in 1881 in present-day Bosnia-Herzegovina, after the Turkish occupation which had lasted more than four centuries.\nHis pastoral ministry in the Archdiocese of Vrhbosna, Sarajevo began on 19 January 1991. In those months in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, as also in the rest of what used to be Yugoslavia and in other formerly communist countries, after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, there was a spell of freedom and democracy. As Archbishop, he immediately focused on making pastoral visits in the Diocese in order to become more familiar with the religious and social situation there.\nDuring these visits he paid particular attention to the meetings with priests. But signs of the evil to come were soon evident. In August 1991 hostilities in Croatia began. In Bosnia-Herzegovina fighting broke out in November and in Ravno in the south of the country, and in April 1992 attacks on the towns, including Sarajevo began.\nIn the situation created by the war, he immediately became involved in helping the thousands of refugees and exiles, mobilizing all the forces of the Church and people of good will. He began in particular to launch heartfelt appeals for the respect of the inalienable rights of the human person without distinction of race or religious creed, for the right of each to live in his own home, for mutual respect, for unity in plurality. At times, there was opposition to such appeals.\nIn his tireless work of peace making, he met with many political figures and politicians, at home and abroad. In addition, to give a greater impulse to the commitment of religion for a just peace, he met more than once with the Orthodox and Muslim religious leaders of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In this respect, it is enough to remember the interreligious meeting held from 1-3 October 1993 in Sarajevo with Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, President of the Pontifical Councils of Justice and Peace and 'Cor Unum'; with the Apostolic Nuncio in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Archbishop Francesco Monterisi; with the Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish and Muslim religious leaders of the city and of the country. And also, the meeting on 17 May 1994 at Sarajevo airport, with the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Alexis II, Patriarch Pavle of the Serbian Orthodox Church, and Cardinal Franjo Kuharić, Metropolitan Archbishop of Zagreb.\nDuring the war, he frequently risked his life while making pastoral trips to his parishes, especially those affected by the scourge of war. In one of these visits he was imprisoned for twelve hours by the Serbian military in Ilida, near Sarajevo, running a serious risk when he rode in a UN military tank of UNPROFOR to Vareš, a town held by the Croatians but which precisely at that time was occupied by the Muslims.\nAlthough he was in the way of those who did not agree with his attitude, he gained widespread esteem among the people and politicians, becoming a reference point at the most difficult moments and in the most acute crises. His radio and written messages have always been positively accepted by the people, both Catholic and Muslim and of other religions. As a witness to so many bitter tears, on behalf of the people suffering because of the war, he has often said: 'Do not leave us alone!', as he said in Milan on 23 September 1993 at an interreligious meeting. More than once he has clearly stated: 'I must raise my voice against all crimes'. Confirming the readiness of Catholics to live together with others, in his speech during his ad limina Apostolorum visit in January 1993, he told the Holy Father: As for us, we are seeking to make contact with the representatives of other religious communities: with the Serbian Orthodox Church and with the Islamic Community'.\nOn various occasions he has shown his ability to be a true Gospel peace-maker, sensitive to the people's suffering, open to dialogue and faithful to the principles of coexistence among the various social, religious and ethnic groups. On 12 November 1992, Pope John Paul II in his letter addressed to all the Bishops of Bosnia-Herzegovina wrote to him: 'When I imposed hands on you on 6 January 1991 to consecrate you in the office of Pastor of the Church of Sarajevo, I had no idea that very shortly your cross would be so heavy and your cup so bitter'.\nIn April 1997, Cardinal Puljić welcomes John Paul II to Sarajevo; a pastoral visit the Holy Father had desired to make in September 1994 but was unable to due to the war.\nSince March 2015 he has been President of the Bishops’ Conference of Bosnia-Ercegovina. He has already been President from from 1995 to 2002, and from 2005 to 2010.\nHe participated in the conclave of April 2005, which elected Pope Benedict XVI and in the conclave of March 2013, which elected Pope Francis.\nFrom 29 January 2022 is Archbishop emeritus of Vrhbosna, Sarajevo (Bosnia-Ercegovina).\nCreated and proclaimed Cardinal by St. John Paul II in the consistory of 26 November 1994, of the Title of S. Chiara a Vigna Clara (St. Clare in Vigna Clara)."

He attended the first three years of primary school at theColegio de Jesús de Candelaria, the fourth year in theEscuela Pública Miguel Hidalgo y Costillain Chimaltenango, and the fifth and sixth years in theColegio El Rosario. He then completed his preparation in the conciliar minor seminary of Santiago, again in the archdiocese of Guatemala. He studied philosophy and theology in the Salesian Theological Institute, and concluded his formation for the priesthood in Mexico, in the diocesan seminary of Mérida, in the Yucatán.\nHe was ordained a priest on 27 June 1971 in the cathedral of Guatemala by Archbishop Mario Casariego, who immediately engaged him to take care of theSeminario Mayor Nacional de La Asunción. In that period, precisely between 1976 and 1980, he studied canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he was awarded a doctorate.\nUpon returning to Guatemala, he was first formator and then professor of theology and then, from 1983 to 1986, rector of theSeminario Mayor Nacional de La Asunción. He also taught theology and canon law at the Salesian Theological Institute, accompanying these services with pastoral care in the parishes.\nOn 15 December 1988, John Paul II appointed him as bishop of San Marcos and on 6 January 1989, personally conferring ordination in Saint Peter’s Basilica.¡Ay de mí sino evangelizo!(“Woe is me if I do not evangelize!”) is his episcopal motto. In the diocese he founded the pastoral care of the land, recognizing the value of agricultural resources and the dignity of rural workers, and the House of the migrant, for the protection of unaccompanied minors in particular.\nIn 1990 he became secretary general of the Guatemalan Episcopal Conference (CEG), within which he has held numerous offices; he was elected president in 2006. He completed his term in 2008 and is currently responsible for the Commissions for social communications and for justice and solidarity. He has also served as head of social pastoral care, of national Caritas, of the pastoral ministry of communications, and of the pastoral care of prisoners and of “movilidad humana”, human mobility.\nAgain within the CEG, he has assumed a prominent role in promoting peace during the civil war that afflicted the country between 1960 to 1996: indeed, he was delegate of the Guatemalan bishops in the “Comisión multi partita” for ascertaining the communities of the civil population in resistance in the north of Quiché (1990-1994) and member of the religious sector in the national reconciliation Commission, which permitted the birth of the national dialogue (1991-1996).\nFrom 2000 to 2006 he chaired theServicio internacional cristiano de solidaridad con los pueblos de América latina “Óscar Romero” (Sicsal)and from 2001 to 2005 the Episcopal Secretariat of Central America (Sedac). He has made a significant contribution in the Latin American Episcopal Council (Celam): he took part in the general conferences of 1992 in Santo Domingo and in 2007 in Aparecida; and between 1991 and 1995 he was head of the section for ecumenism and interreligious dialogue.\nIn 2011 he received the “Pacem in terris” prize – awarded “to honour a person who is distinguished in peace and justice, not only in his own country but in the world” – and on 14 May 2012 he was transferred by Benedict XVI to the residential see of Huehuetenango, which has almost a million faithful, on the border with the Mexican state of Chiapas. Since his entry into the diocese, the following 14 July, he has furthered his service among the poor, becoming a point of reference especially for indigenous populations which suffer violence and injustice.\nWithin the Roman Curia, since 1990 he is a member of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, and from 1991 to 1996 he has been a member of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue. In 1997 he took part in the special Assembly for America in the Synod of Bishops.\nCreated and proclaimed Cardinal by Pope Francis in the consistory of 5 October 2019, of the Title of San Giovanni Evangelista a Spinaceto.\nMember of:",
